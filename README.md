- Hello! Iâ€™m @Natsu1579
  
  As a new junior data analyst I am equipped to analyze complex datasets and extract actionable insights. My experience includes hands-on projects using Python, Excel, and R where I've cleaned, manipulated, and visualized data to uncover trends and patterns. I am eager to contribute my analytical skills and passion for data to grow in the data space and learn from those more experienced than me!
